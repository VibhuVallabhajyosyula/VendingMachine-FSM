# VendingMachine-FSM
This project simulates the behavior of a vending machine using a finite state machine (FSM). It handles three states (s0, s1, s2) corresponding to no coin, 5rs, and 10rs inputs. Based on the input (a), it updates the next_state, dispenses the output (b), and provides change (change). The FSM transitions are clock-driven and resettable.
